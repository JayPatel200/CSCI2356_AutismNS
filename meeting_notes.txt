Notes on what they want:
========================
- it needs to be very simple to prevent autism student from shutting down

- Body broken into beginning middle end (step 1 in the development of a autism ns student)
- Body just one big box (step 2 in the development of the autism ns student)

- Prompt questions one certain parts of the website
- Keep the help windows separate from the main website
- Colour coding and separation are helpful (dull colours best since they are not distracting)

- Limit amount of information given at one time (keep language simple and direct)

IDEAS:
- onclick the body textarea brings up the help window?
- admin has control over the level of 'help' the student will get <======they want this========<
- drop down list -> auto-complete -> free-type on fields such as to/cc
- admin system can change the FROM field so they can impersonate people
- 'click for help' to make sure students know what they can do & what symbols mean
- contacts page?
- usable on BOTH mobile and desktop
- example emails: to a prof, to a friend, to your mom
- example phrases: what are some things to say
- indicator from NO REPLY REQUIRED ------------0---- REPLY IMMEDIATELY
- confirm send page with a checklist of things you need & questions on 'do you want to send this to: ...'
- lowest amount of help should be very close to real email servers such as gmail
- user can flag emails
- scalability to 20+ students with one councillor?
- sequenced email sending: To screen first, CC next, etc... (simplified for mobile devices? meh... not great)

-> STOP SIGN: means stop pause and go

- analytical and review tools for the administrator???? (this is a lot of work, and very hard to be better than paper and pencil in real life)
