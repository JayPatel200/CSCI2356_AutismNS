    - I created this text file so we can discuss ideas, make decisions and assign tasks for ourselves for this project.
    
    - To keep things organized, I suggest that we write the date before the first message of the day and our names so we know who's
    speaking. Let me know what you guys think.

    - Alright folks, first things first. The due date for the first part of the project is March 9th, so I suggest that we first finish
    everything that is a requirement for P1, because it's fast and pretty straight forward, and then we start implementing the stuff 
    from the meeting. Here's a breakdown of what we need:
        + INBOX PAGE
            * Highlighted emails should now have a gray (or coloured) background.
            * A delete button needs to be added to the right of the email.
            * The delete button should turn red when hovered.
            
        + COMPOSING PAGE
            * The cursor needs to turn into an arrow with a question mark when hovering a header field.
            * Clicking a header field should open a smaller window with information about it.
            
        + VIEWING INBOX ITEM & VIEWING SENT ITEM
            * The cursor needs to turn into an arrow with a question mark when hovering a header field.
            
        + VIEWING INBOX ITEM
            * Add a "Reply" Button that links this page to "Composing".
            
        + IMPORTANT INFORMATION
            * We should have 2 systems that are identical: one for the student and one for the Admin. The only difference is that the
            student's system should have the title "Your Email System" on every page, and the admin's system should have "Admin Email
            System". So the easiest way now would be to have 2 files for each webpage, one for the admin and one for the student.
            * Each system requires its own independent local storage, for both inbox and sent items.
           
    - I think each one of us should work on different documents at once to avoid problems when merging branches.
    
    - I'll start working on the Inbox page (Email highlighting, deleting emails and local storage)
    
    - Justin, I checked the html files on the repository and I have a suggestion to make. Do you mind if I replace the divs that act
    like headers, content, footer, etc, for actual <header>, <main>, <footer>, etc, tags? The reason for this is that these tags 
    improve the accessibility of the webpage. If a student is using a screen reader software, it will be able to differentiate the
    sections of the webpage so the student can navigate it better. What do you think?

  =========
-I already finished a bunch of this stuff. Make sure you're running the most recent code by running 'git pull' when in your local    
 project directory. Give the current system some tests! It'd suck to have you work on stuff that is already finshed.
-Sounds like a great idea to change the tags. I just kept them as-is since they're simple for me to understand but knock yourself out 
 if you want to improve it!
-Also really important: make sure you're pulling from the master branch!

    - I'll work on the clickable headers and help info then.
    - Just tested the current system. Looks good!

    - Just went on an adventure and found a nifty way to organize who's doing what.
    - https://github.com/just1ngray/CSCI2356_AutismNS/projects/1
    - You can create notes by pressing +, and move them around by dragging.
    - If you guys still want to use this, I am cool with that
